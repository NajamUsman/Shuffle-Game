# Shuffle-Game

This is a shuffle game 

In this Game, a list of 3 items will be generated and then shuffled 

Your job is to guess where the item is in the list by guessing an Index, the item you are looking for is 'O'

You get one guess and then the program ends 

This is a mini-arcade game which you could find as an option in a discord bot or you could just play it to pass time

To make the game harder we can add more items to the list so that the probability of getting the answer correct decreases
